# nosql-challenge

This project uses MongoDB to store and analyze UK food establishment data. I worked with JSON data from the Food Standards Agency and used PyMongo in Jupyter Notebook to connect to the MongoDB server, query the data, and update records. The setup includes inserting a new restaurant, modifying fields like RatingValue, and removing entries based on specific conditions such as location.

In the analysis section, I answered questions using filters, regex, sorting, and aggregation to explore the data. I found establishments with certain hygiene scores, those located in London with high ratings, and analyzed local authority areas based on cleanliness. All results were converted into DataFrames and displayed using basic pandas functionality. This project helped strengthen my skills in working with NoSQL databases and running real-world data queries in Python.

I just want to say I worked on this months ago and my data was working fine and I had lots of problems importing, while overcoming some of them I failed a few. I hope you understand.
